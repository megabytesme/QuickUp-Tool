# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to QuickUp Tool! This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application. QuickUp Tool is designed to help users upload their selected files to a file host (currently supports file.io). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## Information Collection and Use

### File Uploads

When you use QuickUp Tool to upload a file, the file is directly transferred to file.io. We do not have access to the contents of the files you upload, nor do we store any information about the files.

## Third-Party Services

### file.io

QuickUp Tool uses file.io as the file hosting service. Please review file.io's privacy policy to understand how your data is handled by them: https://www.file.io/privacy/

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
